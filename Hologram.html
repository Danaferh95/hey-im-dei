                <p>This project was made for <strong>Derretina</strong> a Vj/Mapping event that took place in "El Utero", a cultural center located in Quito, Ecuador.</p>
                <p>At first I was thinking about making a sculpture and then map it, but then I thought, why not try out a hologram?</p>

                <p>So I remember seeing a tutorial on youtube about how to make a hologram using a pyramid like structure. The one I found was using a phone, but as I was planning on using a TV I had to do the math to convert the proportions.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The next step was making it interactive, since just having the hologram would be kind of boring. Using <strong>Processing</strong> I conected it to <strong>Resolume Arena</strong>.</p>
            <p>The idea was to have a 3D eye at the center of the pyramid, surrounded by a circular mask. When it <strong>detected sound the circle would become bigger</strong>, revealing a background animation around the eye.</p>
            <p>The instalation was a success! It was great watching people interact with it.</p>
